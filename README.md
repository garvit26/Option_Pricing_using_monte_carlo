# Option Pricing with Monte Carlo Simulations 🎲



A Python-based financial model that estimates the fair value of European Call and Put options using **Monte Carlo Simulations**. This project simulates thousands of random future stock price paths based on **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** to determine fair market premiums.

## 🧠 The Math Behind the Model

The simulation relies on the **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** stochastic differential equation, which models the random behavior of asset prices over time:

$$S_t = S_{t-1} \cdot e^{(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)dt + \sigma\epsilon\sqrt{dt}}$$

Where:
* **$S_t$**: Stock price at time $t$
* **$\mu$ (Drift)**: Expected return, approximated here by the risk-free rate ($r$).
* **$\sigma$ (Volatility)**: The standard deviation of the stock's historical returns.
* **$\epsilon$ (Random Shock)**: A random variable drawn from a standard normal distribution.

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Uses `yfinance` to pull real-time historical data for any ticker (e.g., TSLA, AAPL).
* **Visual Analytics:** Generates matplotlib charts to visualize the spread of potential future stock prices.
* **Dual Pricing:** Calculates premiums for both **Call** (betting the price goes up) and **Put** (betting the price goes down) options.
* **Customizable Parameters:** Easy adjustment of variables like iterations, risk-free rate, and time horizon.
